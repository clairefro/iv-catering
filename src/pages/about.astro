      <p>I'm Regina Iovino, and this is my kitchen.</p>
      <p>
        I'm the former owner and chef of Iovino's Restaurant in Corvallis. An
        Italian chef at heart, I'm inspired by the rich traditions, flavors, and
        spirit of Italy. I learned that food is more than something on a plate.
        It's how we show love, how we celebrate, and how we bring people
        together. I cook the way I speak: with my hands, with passion, and with
        my whole heart. If you see me gesturing over a simmering pot, that's
        just part of the experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, catering isn't about trays of food, it's about creating moments.
        I want you and your guests to feel welcomed, cared for, and completely
        satisfied. I want laughter around the table, seconds (and thirds), and
        memories that linger long after the last bite. Feeding people brings me
        pure joy. And yes, my contagious laugh usually makes an appearance at
        every event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's an intimate dinner, a family celebration, or a grand
        gathering, I pour authenticity, generosity, and vibrant Italian flavor
        into everything I create.
      </p>
      <p>Come hungry - I'll take care of the rest.</p>
